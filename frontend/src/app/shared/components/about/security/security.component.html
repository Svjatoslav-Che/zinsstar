      3. Cookies
      <br>
      The Internet pages of Zinsunion Limited use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored and stored on a computer system via an internet browser.
      <br><br>
      Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the websites and servers visited to distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.
      <br><br>
      By using cookies, the Zinsunion Limited can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
      <br><br>
      Using a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized in the interests of the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable us to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter their access data every time they visit the website, because this is done by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online shop. The online shop uses a cookie to remember the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart.
      <br><br>
      The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable.
      <br><br>
      4. Collection of general data and information
      <br>
      The website of the Zinsunion Limited collects a series of general data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. These general data and information are stored in the server's log files. The (1) browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website can be controlled, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address),
      <br><br>
      When using these general data and information, the Zinsunion Limited does not draw any conclusions about the person concerned. Rather, this information is required to (1) correctly deliver the content of our website, (2) optimize the content of our website and the advertising for it, (3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website and ( 4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber attack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore evaluated statistically by the Zinsunion Limited on the one hand and also with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our company, in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data in the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
      <br><br>
      5. Registration on our website
      <br>
      The data subject has the option of registering on the website of the controller by providing personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the person responsible for the processing results from the respective input mask that is used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the person responsible for processing and for their own purposes. The person responsible for processing can arrange for the data to be passed on to one or more processors, for example a parcel service provider, who will also use the personal data exclusively for internal use,
      <br><br>
      By registering on the website of the person responsible for processing, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the person concerned, the date and time of registration are also saved. This data is stored against the background that this is the only way to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, to enable criminal offenses to be investigated. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary to protect the person responsible for processing. This data is generally not passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to pass it on or it is used for criminal prosecution.
      <br><br>
      The registration of the data subject with the voluntary provision of personal data enables the data controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to change the personal data provided during registration at any time or to have them completely deleted from the database of the person responsible for processing.
      <br><br>
      The person responsible for processing will provide any person concerned with information about which personal data is stored about the person concerned at any time upon request. Furthermore, the person responsible for processing corrects or deletes personal data at the request or advice of the person concerned, provided that there are no statutory retention requirements. The entirety of the employees of the person responsible for the processing are available to the data subject as contact persons in this context.

      <br><br>
      Zinsunion Limited informs its customers and business partners at regular intervals by means of a newsletter about company offers. Our company's newsletter can generally only be received by the person concerned if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers to receive the newsletter. For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by a person concerned for the first time for the newsletter dispatch using the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the email address, as the person concerned, has authorized the receipt of the newsletter.
      <br><br>
      When registering for the newsletter, we also save the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later point in time and therefore serves as a legal safeguard for the person responsible for processing.
      <br><br>
      The personal data collected when registering for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a relevant registration, as this could be the case in the case of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical conditions. The personal data collected as part of the newsletter service will not be passed on to third parties. The data subject can cancel the subscription to our newsletter at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data that the data subject has given us for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time. There is a corresponding link in every newsletter for the purpose of withdrawing consent. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter dispatch directly on the website of the person responsible for processing or to inform the person responsible for processing of this in another way.
      <br><br>
      7. Newsletter-Tracking
      The Zinsunion Limited newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in e-mails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. This enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns to be carried out. Using the embedded tracking pixel, the Zinsunion Limited can recognize whether and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject and which links in the e-mail were called up by the data subject.
      <br><br>
      Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and evaluated by the person responsible for processing in order to optimize the sending of the newsletter and to better adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the person concerned. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Affected persons are entitled at any time to revoke the relevant separate declaration of consent given via the double opt-in procedure. After a revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the person responsible for processing. The Zinsunion Limited automatically interprets a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.
      <br><br>
      8. Contact options via the website
      <br>
      The website of the Zinsunion Limited contains information that enables quick electronic contact to our company and direct communication with us, which also includes a general address for so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).

Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the person responsible for processing are stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject.

      Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the person concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged into Facebook at the same time as accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their Facebook account before calling up our website.
      <br><br>
      The data guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains which setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the person concerned. In addition, different applications are available that make it possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook.

      12. Data protection provisions on the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
      <br>
      The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, collection and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors to Internet pages. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on the website from which a person concerned came to a website (so-called referrer), which sub-pages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
      <br><br>
      The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.
      <br><br>
      The person responsible for processing uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned is shortened and anonymized by Google if our Internet pages are accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another signatory to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.
      <br><br>
      Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are has already been explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the person responsible for processing and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically triggered by the respective Google Analytics component To transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which Google uses, among other things, to
      <br><br>
      The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which access was made and the frequency of visits to our website by the person concerned. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass this personal data collected through the technical process on to third parties.
      <br><br>
      The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics relating to the use of this website as well as the processing of this data by Google and to prevent this. To do this, the person concerned must download and install a browser add-on from the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data or information on visits to websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the person concerned is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later date, the person concerned must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person who is attributable to their sphere of influence, there is the option of reinstalling or reactivating the browser add-on.
      <br><br>
      Further information and the applicable data protection regulations from Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/.
      <br><br>
      13. Data protection provisions on the application and use of Google Remarketing
      <br>
      The person responsible for processing has integrated Google Remarketing services on this website. Google Remarketing is a function of Google AdWords that enables a company to show advertisements to Internet users who have previously been on the company's website. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows a company to create user-related advertising and consequently to show interest-relevant advertisements to the Internet user.
      <br><br>
      The operating company for the services of Google Remarketing is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of Google Remarketing is to show interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing enables us to display advertisements via the Google advertising network or to have them displayed on other websites that are tailored to the individual needs and interests of Internet users.
      <br><br>
      Google Remarketing places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is able to recognize visitors to our website if they subsequently access websites that are also members of the Google advertising network. Every time a website is accessed on which the Google Remarketing service has been integrated, the data subject's internet browser automatically identifies itself to Google. As part of this technical process, Google gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address or the surfing behavior of the user, which Google uses, among other things, to display interest-relevant advertising.
      <br><br>
      The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the person concerned. Every time you visit our website, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass this personal data collected through the technical process on to third parties.
      <br><br>
      The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
      <br><br>
      The data subject also has the option of objecting to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from each of the Internet browsers they use and make the desired settings there.
      <br><br>
      Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.
      <br><br>
      14. Data protection provisions on the application and use of Google AdWords
      <br>
      The person responsible for processing has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads in Google's search engine results as well as in the Google advertising network. Google AdWords enables an advertiser to define certain keywords in advance by means of which an advertisement is only displayed in Google's search engine results if the user calls up a keyword-relevant search result with the search engine. In the Google advertising network, the ads are distributed to topic-related websites using an automatic algorithm and taking into account the previously defined keywords.
      <br><br>
      The operating company for the services of Google AdWords is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of Google AdWords is to advertise our website by displaying interest-relevant advertising on the websites of third-party companies and in the search engine results of the Google search engine and by displaying third-party advertising on our website.
      <br><br>
      If a person concerned reaches our website via a Google ad, a so-called conversion cookie is stored on the information technology system of the person concerned by Google. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, for example the shopping cart from an online shop system, have been accessed on our website. The conversion cookie enables both we and Google to understand whether a person concerned who came to our website via an AdWords ad generated sales, i.e. completed or canceled a purchase.
      <br><br>
      The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie are used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are in turn used by us to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords advertisements, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords advertisement and to optimize our AdWords advertisements for the future . Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the person concerned.
      <br><br>
      The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the person concerned. Every time you visit our website, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass this personal data collected through the technical process on to third parties.
      <br><br>
      The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
      <br><br>
      The data subject also has the option of objecting to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from each of the Internet browsers they use and make the desired settings there.
      <br><br>
      Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.
      <br><br>
      15. Data protection provisions on the application and use of Instagram
      <br>
      The person responsible for processing has integrated components of the Instagram service on this website. Instagram is a service that qualifies as an audiovisual platform and enables users to share photos and videos and also to disseminate such data in other social networks.
      <br><br>
      The operating company for Instagram services is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2 Ireland.
      <br><br>
      Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the person responsible for processing and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically replaced by the respective Instagram component causes a representation of the corresponding component to be downloaded from Instagram. As part of this technical process, Instagram receives information about which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person concerned.
      <br><br>
      If the person concerned is logged in to Instagram at the same time, Instagram recognizes which specific sub-page the person concerned is visiting with each visit to our website by the person concerned and for the entire duration of their stay on our website. This information is collected by the Instagram component and assigned to the respective Instagram account of the person concerned. If the person concerned clicks one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, the data and information transferred are assigned to the personal Instagram user account of the person concerned and stored and processed by Instagram.
      <br><br>
      Instagram always receives information via the Instagram component that the person concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged in to Instagram at the same time as accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on the Instagram component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Instagram, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their Instagram account before visiting our website.
      <br><br>
      Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram can be found at https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388 and https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.
      <br><br>
      16. Legal basis for processing
      <br>
      Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are required to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, for example to fulfill tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, it may be necessary to process personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our company were injured and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would then have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).
      <br><br>
      17. Legitimate interests in the processing that are being pursued by the controller or a third party
      <br>
      If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit.f GDPR, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our business activities for the benefit of all our employees and our shareholders.
      <br><br>
      18. Duration for which the personal data will be stored
      <br>
      The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the period has expired, the relevant data is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required to fulfill or initiate a contract.
      <br><br>
      19. Statutory or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision
      <br>
      We explain to you that the provision of personal data is in part required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the contractual partner). In order to conclude a contract, it may sometimes be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data that we subsequently have to process. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data when our company concludes a contract with them. Failure to provide personal data would mean that the contract could not be concluded with the person concerned. Before the person concerned provides personal data, the person concerned must contact one of our employees.
      <br><br>
      20. Existence of automated decision-making
      <br>
      As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.
